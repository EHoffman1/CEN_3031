The Matchmakers

For our GUI project final, we created an application for a student housing complex. The application allows the owners to create admin accounts for themselves or the resident assistants where they can view the payments of the student residents, create events for the students to attend, view maintenance requests from residents, and view all residents that have created an account. It also allows student residents to create their own accounts where they can upload and store their lease documents, submit maintenance requests, submit payments, and view the events created by the admins.
